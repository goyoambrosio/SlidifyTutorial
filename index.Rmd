## R presentations

R presentations are presentations coded as Rmarkdown and then translated to HTML
using the R programming language framework.

Rmarkdown is a markdown based R syntax that helps make documents in many different formats.

There are many different ways to make *r presentations* in RStudio (`oslides`, `Slidy`, `Beamer`, ...)

Slidify exists as a package with a huge online community and popularity.

Slidify has the most options and flexibility but you mustn't to use it until you
are more comfortable with R packages and general syntax.

*** =pnotes

R presentations are presentations coded as HTML created with the R programming language framework.

Rmarkdown is a markdown based R syntax that helps make documents in many different formats.

In RStudio, you simply create a new rmarkdown file, write your text/code, and
runs `knitr` and `pandoc` to turn your raw text into a complete HTML, named *r
presentations*, or PDF document.

There are many different ways to make *r presentations* in RStudio but three main
choices: `ioslides`, `Slidy`, and `Beamer`.

On the other hand, Slidify exists as a package with a huge online community and popularity.

Slidify has the most options and flexibility. This package is clearly aimed at
the intermediate to advanced R community and you mustn't to use slidify until
you are more comfortable with R packages and general syntax.

Slidify also uses `knitr` but renders HTML pages by itself without using `pandoc`

## What is Slidify

Slidify is a tool that makes it easy to create, customize and publish,
reproducible HTML5 slide decks using R Markdown.

Slidify helps create, customize and share, elegant, dynamic and interactive
HTML5 documents using R Markdown.

---

## Installation

Obviously you need a R environment. For that, install
[R](https://www.r-project.org/) and [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/)

Slidify is not on CRAN and needs to be installed from github using the devtools
package. I would recommend installing the dev version of the package.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
pkgs <- c("slidify", "slidifyLibraries", "rCharts")
devtools::install_github(pkgs, "ramnathv")
```

slidify.github.io recommends installing the `dev` version of the package

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install_github(pkgs, 'ramnathv', ref = 'dev')
```

Now you are ready to create your first slidify presentation.

--- 
## Create a new Deck

Each presentation is called a 'deck'. To create a new deck open RStudio, set
your working directory and use the `author` command.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
setwd("/path/to/")
require(slidify)
author("myDeck")
```

`/path/to/myDeck` is created.

Create a R Project from Existing Directory

```
File -> New Project -> Existing Directory -> /path/to/myDeck -> Create Project
```

A file called `myDeck.Rproj` will be created under `/path/to/myDeck`.

---

## Integration with Git 

If git is installed, then the `author` command also initializes a git repository,
switchs to a `gh-pages` branch and commit all changes.

Before uploading your deck to your favourite Git cloud provider create
`.gitignore` to avoid version control for non essential files.

```shell
$ cd /path/to/myDeck
$ touch .gitignore
$ vim .gitignore
```

Add your ignored extensions

```bash
# RStudio files #
.Rproj.user
.Rhistory
.RData
.Ruserdata
# ...
```

---

## Upload the new repository (Bitbucket or GitHub)

Create an empty Repository, e.g. `myDeck` in BitBucket or GitHub. With an empty
repository a default branch called `master` won't be created. Then `push` the
local `myDeck` repository to the remote `myDeck` repo. Note that a new branch
called `gh-pages` has been created.

```shell
$ cd /path/to/myDeck
$ git add .
$ git commit -am "Initial commit"
$ git remote add origin_github https://github.com/username/myDeck.git
$ git remote add origin_bitbucket https://username@bitbucket.org/username/myDeck.git
$ git push -u origin_[github|bitbucket] --all
$ git push -u origin_[github|bitbucket] --tags
```

Now you can work with your new repository as usual

---

## Cloning your repo

To clone the repo on your machine take in account that you'll need to clone `gh-pages` branch

```shell
git clone -b gh-pages https://github.com/username/myDeck.git
```

or

```shell,eval=FALSE}
git clone -b gh-page https://username@bitbucket.org/username/myDeck.git
```

## Editing index.Rmd

index.Rmd is the only file you need to edit and for that you have two ways:

- Using RStudio opening the project file, e.g. `/path/to/myDeck/myDeck.Rproj`
- Using Emacs with ESS/Polymode major mode.

To take advantage of their editing capabilities RStudio and Emacs can be used simultaneously.

Changes made to the edited files will be updated in real time both in Emacs and RStudio.

--- 

## Using Emacs

For R files editing in Emacs you'll need to install ESS & polymode major modes.

Previously is recommended [spacemacs](http://spacemacs.org/) installation over Emacs.

Spacemacs is an open source Emacs distribution, aimed at providing a bridge
between Emacs and Vim.

Emacs Speaks Statistics (ESS) is an add-on package for Emacs. It is designed to
support editing of scripts and interaction with various statistical analysis
programs such as R.

Polymode is an emacs package that offers generic support for multiple major
modes inside a single emacs buffer. It is necessary to allow the mix of modes
present in Rmd files, specially `markdown` and `R` modes but also other major
modes.

---

## Configuring Emacs for Rmd files editing.

Edit `.spacemacs`

1. Activate `ess` configuration layer  
```
dotspacemacs-configuration-layers
'(ess)
```

2. Add `polymode` package as additional package  
```
dotspacemacs-additional-packages '(polymode)
```

3. Add extension associations  
```
dotspacemacs/user-config ()
(add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.Rmd$" . poly-markdown+r-mode))
```

---

## Slidify it !

```{r, eval=FALSE}
slidify("index.Rmd")
browseURL("index.html")
```

## Code hightlighting

We want that our code blocks look good. Syntax highlighting let us to make code clear and understable.


Usage:

```markdown

    ```<language>
    ... code
    ```

```

knitr converts `{<language_name> ...}` to `<language_name>` but the language
name in kinitr corresponds to the engine that executes the code but does not
have to correspond to the name used by hightlight.js


---

## Using Hightlight.js

Highlight.js is a syntax highlighter written in JavaScript. It works with pretty
much any markup, doesn’t depend on any framework and has automatic language
detection.

Main features

- 176 languages and 79 styles
- automatic language detection
- multi-language code highlighting
- available for node.js
- works with any markup
- compatible with any js framework

## Knitr

The [knitr](https://yihui.name/knitr/demo/engines/) package was designed based
on the idea of “Literate Programming” (Knuth 1984), which allows you to
intermingle program code with text in a source document.

When knitr compiles a document, the program code (in code chunks) will
be extracted and executed, and the program output will be displayed together
with the original text in the output document.

knitr support a lot of computer languages that implemented in [knitr language
engines](https://yihui.name/knitr/demo/engines/**.

## Presenter display and presenter notes

You can define speaker notes within any slide by adding the line `*** =pnotes`
before it. Here is an example of a slide with speaker notes.

You can view speaker notes by pressing the key `p` which acts as a toggle and
automatically opens the presenter view. 

For `io2012`, you need to add `?presentme=true` to the presentation url, which
will then open the presenter view.

You can also include an image in the presenter display using markdown syntax,
e.g.
`![](http://codingsomething.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/screenshot.png?w=652)`

    *** =pnotes
    Presenter notes
    ![](http://codingsomething.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/screenshot.png?w=652)
